## 🚨 Contribution Rules (Strict Enforcement)

> **Read this section carefully before doing anything. Violations will result in your PR being closed without review.**

- ❌ **Do NOT open PRs for issues unless you are officially assigned**
- ❌ **Do NOT create new issues** - issues are created and managed only by organizers
- ❌ **PRs without a linked issue (or team number) will be closed immediately**
- ❌ **PRs for unassigned issues will be closed without merging**
- ❌ **Do NOT self-assign issues**
- ✅ **One issue per contributor at a time** - finish and submit before picking another
- ✅ **Only maintainers can assign, review, and merge PRs** - do not ask others to merge your PR
- ✅ **Every PR must include your Team Number** in the description
- ✅ **General improvement PRs** (bug fixes or enhancements outside existing issues) are allowed but reviewed strictly - you must still include your team number and clearly explain the change

---

## 📌 Issue Policy

## 🛠 Tech Stack

This project uses:
- **Runtime**: Node.js
- **Framework**: Express.js
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **ORM**: Prisma (or as configured in the repo)
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **Package Manager**: npm

---

## ✅ Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) (v14 or higher)
- A code editor (VS Code recommended)
- A REST API client like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or [Thunder Client](https://www.thunderclient.com/) (VS Code extension)

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Step 1: Fork the Repository

1. Navigate to the [Zaplink Backend repository](https://github.com/gdg-charusat/Zaplink_backend)
2. Click the **Fork** button in the top-right corner
3. This creates a copy of the repository in your GitHub account

### Step 2: Clone Your Fork

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Zaplink_backend.git
cd Zaplink_backend
```

Replace `YOUR-USERNAME` with your GitHub username.

### Step 3: Add Upstream Remote

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/gdg-charusat/Zaplink_backend.git
```

Verify the remotes:

```bash
git remote -v
```

You should see:
- `origin` — your fork (`https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Zaplink_backend.git`)
- `upstream` — the original repository (`https://github.com/gdg-charusat/Zaplink_backend.git`)

### Step 4: Set Up Environment Variables

```bash
# Copy the example env file
cp .env.example .env
```

Then open `.env` and fill in your values. Contact organizers for shared credentials (see [Environment Variables](#-environment-variables--secrets) section above).

```env
# Example .env structure
PORT=5000
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/zaplink_db
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_here
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=7d
NODE_ENV=development
```

> ⚠️ **Never commit your `.env` file.** It is already listed in `.gitignore`.

### Step 5: Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Step 6: Set Up the Database

```bash
# Run database migrations
npx prisma migrate dev

# (Optional) Seed the database with initial data
npx prisma db seed
```

If you're not using Prisma, check the repo for migration scripts:

```bash
# For raw SQL migrations (if applicable)
npm run migrate
```

### Step 7: Start the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The server should now be running at `http://localhost:5000` (or whichever port is in your `.env`).

Verify it's working:
```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/health
# Expected: { "status": "ok" }
```

### Step 8: Create a New Branch

**IMPORTANT**: Always create a new branch for your work. Never work directly on the `main` branch.

```bash
# First, sync your fork with upstream
git fetch upstream
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main

# Create and switch to a new branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

**Branch Naming Convention:**
- `feature/` — for new features (e.g., `feature/add-auth-endpoint`)
- `fix/` — for bug fixes (e.g., `fix/user-query-error`)
- `docs/` — for documentation changes (e.g., `docs/update-api-readme`)
- `refactor/` — for code refactoring (e.g., `refactor/optimize-db-queries`)
- `chore/` — for maintenance tasks (e.g., `chore/update-dependencies`)

---

## 💻 Development Workflow

### 1. Pick an Issue

- Browse the [Issues](https://github.com/gdg-charusat/Zaplink_backend/issues) page
- Look for issues labeled:
  - `good-first-issue` or `beginner` — for beginners (Level 1)
  - `intermediate` — for intermediate level (Level 2)
- **Comment on the issue** with your request and team number, e.g.:
  > *"Hi, I'd like to work on this issue. — Team 07"*
- **Wait to be officially assigned** — do not start writing any code until a maintainer assigns you
- **Do not work on an issue already assigned to someone else**

### 2. Make Your Changes

- Write clean, readable code
- Follow the project's code style guidelines (see below)
- Test all your API endpoints using Postman or Thunder Client
- Ensure the server runs without errors or warnings

### 3. Test Your Changes

```bash
# Run the development server
npm run dev

# Run tests (if applicable)
npm run test

# Check for linting errors
npm run lint
```

Always test your endpoints manually before submitting a PR:
- ✅ Success cases (200, 201)
- ✅ Error cases (400, 401, 403, 404, 500)
- ✅ Edge cases (empty input, invalid data, missing fields)

### 4. Commit Your Changes

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add user authentication endpoint"
```

**Commit Message Format:**
- `feat:` — new feature (e.g., `feat: add password reset endpoint`)
- `fix:` — bug fix (e.g., `fix: handle null value in user query`)
- `docs:` — documentation (e.g., `docs: add API endpoint docs`)
- `refactor:` — code restructuring (e.g., `refactor: simplify auth middleware`)
- `test:` — adding tests (e.g., `test: add unit tests for user service`)
- `chore:` — maintenance tasks (e.g., `chore: update prisma schema`)

**Examples of Good Commit Messages:**
```bash
feat: add POST /api/links endpoint with validation
fix: resolve 500 error on invalid JWT token
refactor: move database logic to service layer
docs: document link creation API in README
chore: add zod schema for request validation
```

### 5. Push to Your Fork

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### 6. Create a Pull Request

1. Go to your fork on GitHub: `https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Zaplink_backend`
2. Click **"Compare & pull request"** button
3. Fill out the PR template completely:
   - **Title**: Clear, descriptive title (e.g., `feat: add link creation endpoint`)
   - **Team Number**: You **must** state your team number (e.g., `Team 07`) — PRs without this will be closed
   - **Issue Reference**: Link the assigned issue (e.g., `Closes #42`) — PRs without a linked issue will be closed unless it's a general improvement PR
   - **Description**: Explain what endpoint/logic you added or changed and why
   - **API Changes**: Document any new or modified endpoints (method, route, request body, response)
4. Click **"Create pull request"**

> 💡 **For General Improvement PRs** (bugs or enhancements not linked to any issue): You must still include your **Team Number** and a clear explanation of what you changed and why. These PRs are reviewed strictly.

## 📝 Issue Guidelines

### Finding Issues

Issues are categorized by difficulty level and **created exclusively by organizers**:

**Beginner Level (Good First Issues)**
- Adding input validation to existing routes
- Writing helper/utility functions
- Adding error handling to existing endpoints
- Writing documentation for existing APIs
- Labels: `good-first-issue`, `beginner`, `level-1`

**Intermediate Level**
- Building new API endpoints end-to-end
- Database schema changes and migrations
- Authentication/authorization logic
- Business logic implementation
- Performance improvements to queries
- Labels: `intermediate`, `level-2`

### How to Request an Issue

1. Find an unassigned issue you want to work on
2. **Comment on the issue** with this format:
   > *"I'd like to work on this. — Team [your team number]"*
3. **Wait for a maintainer to assign it to you** — this is mandatory
4. Once assigned, start working and submit your PR within **3–5 days**
5. If you can't complete it in time, comment to let maintainers know

> ⚠️ **Do NOT open new issues.** If you spot a bug or have a feature idea, raise it with a maintainer directly in the event channel.

## 🔄 Pull Request Process

### PR Requirements — Non-Negotiable

> PRs that don't meet ALL of the following will be **closed without review**:

- [ ] **Team number stated** in the PR description (e.g., `Team 07`)
- [ ] **Linked to your assigned issue** via `Closes #issue-number` (unless it's a general improvement PR)
- [ ] **You are the assigned contributor** for that issue
- [ ] PR is raised **after** assignment, not before
- [ ] **No `.env` file or secrets committed**

### Before Submitting

- [ ] Server runs without errors (`npm run dev`)
- [ ] All endpoints tested manually (success + error cases)
- [ ] Input validation in place for all new routes
- [ ] Proper HTTP status codes used (200, 201, 400, 401, 404, 500)
- [ ] Error responses follow consistent format
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or credentials
- [ ] No `console.log` statements left in production code
- [ ] Commit messages follow the conventional format

### PR Review Process

1. A maintainer will review your PR within 24–48 hours
2. You may be asked to make changes — respond promptly
3. Make requested changes and push to the same branch (PR auto-updates)
4. **Only maintainers can approve and merge** — do not request peers to merge

### Addressing Review Comments

```bash
# Make the requested changes, then:
git add .
git commit -m "fix: address review comments"
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### General Improvement PRs (No Issue Linked)

If you want to fix a bug or add a small improvement that isn't part of an existing issue, you may raise a PR directly **only if**:
- It is a genuine improvement (not a trivial change)
- Your **Team Number** is clearly stated in the PR description
- You provide a clear explanation of what you changed and why
- You understand it will be **reviewed strictly** and may be closed if not up to standard

## 🎨 Code Style Guidelines

### Project Structure

```
src/
├── routes/          # Express route definitions
├── controllers/     # Route handler logic
├── services/        # Business logic layer
├── middleware/      # Custom middleware (auth, validation, error handling)
├── models/          # Database models / Prisma schema
├── utils/           # Helper functions and utilities
├── validators/      # Request validation schemas (Zod/Joi)
└── config/          # App configuration (db, env, etc.)
```

### Express Routes

```javascript
// ✅ Good - Clean, separated concerns
// routes/link.routes.js
import { Router } from 'express';
import { createLink, getLinks, deleteLink } from '../controllers/link.controller.js';
import { authenticate } from '../middleware/auth.middleware.js';
import { validateCreateLink } from '../validators/link.validator.js';

const router = Router();

router.post('/', authenticate, validateCreateLink, createLink);
router.get('/', authenticate, getLinks);
router.delete('/:id', authenticate, deleteLink);

export default router;

// ❌ Bad - Logic inside route file
router.post('/links', async (req, res) => {
  const result = await db.query('INSERT INTO links...');
  res.json(result);
});
```

### Controllers

```javascript
// ✅ Good - Controller only handles request/response
export const createLink = async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { url, customSlug } = req.body;
    const userId = req.user.id;

    const link = await linkService.create({ url, customSlug, userId });

    return res.status(201).json({
      success: true,
      data: link,
    });
  } catch (error) {
    return res.status(500).json({
      success: false,
      message: error.message,
    });
  }
};

// ❌ Bad - Business logic inside controller
export const createLink = async (req, res) => {
  const { url } = req.body;
  const slug = Math.random().toString(36).substring(2, 8); // ❌ logic here
  await db.query(`INSERT INTO links (url, slug) VALUES ($1, $2)`, [url, slug]);
  res.json({ url, slug });
};
```

### Input Validation

```javascript
// ✅ Good - Always validate input (using Zod example)
import { z } from 'zod';

export const createLinkSchema = z.object({
  url: z.string().url('Must be a valid URL'),
  customSlug: z.string().min(3).max(20).optional(),
});

export const validateCreateLink = (req, res, next) => {
  const result = createLinkSchema.safeParse(req.body);
  if (!result.success) {
    return res.status(400).json({
      success: false,
      message: 'Validation failed',
      errors: result.error.flatten().fieldErrors,
    });
  }
  req.body = result.data;
  next();
};

// ❌ Bad - No validation
export const createLink = async (req, res) => {
  const { url } = req.body; // What if url is undefined? Or not a URL?
  await db.query(`INSERT INTO links (url) VALUES ($1)`, [url]);
};
```

### Error Responses

Always use a **consistent error response format**:

```javascript
// ✅ Good - Consistent format
res.status(400).json({
  success: false,
  message: 'URL is required',
});

res.status(401).json({
  success: false,
  message: 'Unauthorized — invalid or expired token',
});

res.status(404).json({
  success: false,
  message: 'Link not found',
});

// ❌ Bad - Inconsistent formats
res.status(400).send('bad request');
res.json({ error: true, msg: 'not found' });
res.status(500).json('something went wrong');
```

### HTTP Status Codes

Use the correct status code for every response:

| Code | When to Use |
|------|-------------|
| `200` | Successful GET / general success |
| `201` | Resource successfully created (POST) |
| `204` | Success with no response body (DELETE) |
| `400` | Bad request / validation error |
| `401` | Unauthenticated (no/invalid token) |
| `403` | Forbidden (authenticated but not authorized) |
| `404` | Resource not found |
| `409` | Conflict (e.g., duplicate entry) |
| `500` | Internal server error |

### File Naming
